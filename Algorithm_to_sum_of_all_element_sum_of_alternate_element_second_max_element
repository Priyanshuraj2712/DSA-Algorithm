Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize an array of size 5
Step 3: Initialize sum = 0;
Step 4: Iterate the loop from 0 to n
Step 5: Sum = sum +arr[i]
Step 6 print sum
Step 7: Iterate the loop from 0 to n and i = i+2
Step 8: Sum = sum +arr[i]
Step 9: print sum
Step 11: Initialize max and max2 to 0
Step 12: Check if arr[i] = max2
Step 13: Then max2 = max and max = arr[i]
Step 14: Print max
